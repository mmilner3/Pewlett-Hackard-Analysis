# Overview
### The purpose of this project is to assist Pewlette Hackard in quantifying the size of retirees coming thorough the pipeline in the upcoming cycle. I proveded the company with an analysis of the size of the exected retiring wave and the departments in which they will see the biggest impacts. 

## Results
### The following bullets are conclusions drawn from this analysis: 
- Most of the employees ready to retire are senior engineers so the company should invest in their non-senior engineer employees to create good backfills 

- only 2 managers are set to retire so no need to look into backfills for managment roles 

- There are 1549 employees eligable for mentorship programs. 

- Most of the eligible mentors are senior engineers so this creates a good oportunity to develop non-senior engineers 

## summary 
It appears that as this "Silver Tsunami" moves through the company will need to fill 72458 roles in total 

with only 1549 mentorship eligable emloyees there is a substantial risk that there will not be enough support to develop backfills for all these roles. 

## additional queries to look in to: 

What is the ratio of mentorship employees to retiring employees by department? 

what is the break down of retiring employees by time horizon (1 year, 2 year, 3 year, etc.)
